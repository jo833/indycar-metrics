# indycar-metrics

A program that calculates different metrics in IndyCar that can be used for racing strategy. The metrics are based on an ideal scenario with no mention of extenuating circumstances such as driver style or weather.

## The Metrics

The metrics that are being found by the program are total fuel needed, the number of fuel based pit stops that are need, the precent that tyres' degrade per lap based off how many laps the tyres can last, the amount of laps per full tank of gas, the minimum number of pit stops needed based off tyres and gas, and the laps the pit stops need to occur at.

## The Variables

The variables need are the race length in miles, the race length in laps, and how many laps the tyres can last.

That being said there are known variables such as indycars can go for four miles per gallon, the tank holds 18.5 gallons, and the amount of miles that an indycar can go on a tank of gas is 74 miles.
